-- explains need to change the docs.yml to "main" instead of master or else it won't trigger anything
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61989951/github-action-workflow-not-running

Process:
1) pip3 install -U sphinx
2) Within project create docs folder, go into folder and run "sphinx-quickstart"
3) Will automatically create a lot of files
- Makefile: builds the proect
- conf.py: specifies the build
- index.rst (reStructuredText): entry point for the website
4) to make website, run: make html
5) pip3 install sphinx-rtd-theme
6) add some more stuff to the conf.py
7) Generate more .rst files in the doc folder: sphinx-apidoc -o . ../autos
8) link the .rst files
9) add some more code to the conf.py and rerun the html
    make clean html
    make html
    
    
For publishing to github pages:
1) make sure branch is gh-pages and make sure directory is /(root)
