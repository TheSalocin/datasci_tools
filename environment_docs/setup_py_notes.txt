Example: 

from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
   name='web_automation_tools', # the name of the package, which can be different than the folder when using pip instal
   version='1.0',
   description='Usefule Module for Web Scraping and Automation',
   author='Brendan Celii',
   author_email='bac8@rice.edu',
   packages=find_packages(),  #teslls what packages to be included for the install
   install_requires=[
       'pathlib', 
       'beautifulsoup4', 
       'selenium<4.3',
       'pandas',
       'requests',
       'argparse',
   ], #external packages as dependencies
    
    # if wanted to install with the extra requirements use pip install -e ".[interactive]"
    extras_require={
        #'interactive': ['matplotlib>=2.2.0', 'jupyter'],
    },
    
    # if have a python script that wants to be run from the command line
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': ['pipeline_download=Applications.Eleox_Data_Fetch.Eleox_Data_Fetcher_vp1:main']
    },
    scripts=[], 
    

You can then go to the folder and install it using the following to make sure that it is still editable (like you normally do)

pip install -e . 
    --> -e installs it in editable mode)
    --> the . just tells where the setup.py directory can be found

and in jupyter notebooks include the autoreload extension
%load_ext autoreload  # Load the extension
%autoreload 2  # Autoreload all modules

If You specify extra_requires then you can install them in the pip statement
pip install -e ".[interactive]"

# ------- when have a python function to run from the command line ------
Purpose: Want to register a command with the CLI that is essentially you running a python function
from one of your files

Ex: 
funniest/
    funniest/
        __init__.py
        my_function.py
        ...
    setup.py
    bin/
        funniest-joke
    ...
   
setup(
    ...
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': ['silly_function=funniest.my_function:main']
    },
    ...
)


# --------- script argument (when have a bash script to run) -----------
if want to make a bash file available as a command line tool now can include

Ex: 
funniest/
    funniest/
        __init__.py
        ...
    setup.py
    bin/
        funniest-joke
    ...


setup(
    ...
    scripts=['bin/funniest-joke'],
    ...
)
if this was python code the first line would just be #!/usr/bin/env python



--- notes on requirment.txt ----
Purpose: To provide an exhaustive list of all the external dependencies
needed for the package

can use the pipreqs to find out what packages a certain directory imports
(see example in file_utils.py)


Source: https://towardsdatascience.com/requirements-vs-setuptools-python-ae3ee66e28af

# can install of the requirements with 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Example: 

matplotlib>=2.2
numpy>=1.15.0, <1.21.0
pandas
pytest==4.0.1

# will list all of the packages with their pin
pip3 freeze


--- notes on setup.py (source: https://godatadriven.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-using-setup-py/)
Purpose: To make your package globally available by 
using the pip tool (instead of having to add something to our path)

Ex: 
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='example', # the name pip will use for your package (not have to be the same name as folder)
    version='0.1.0',
    packages=find_packages(include=['exampleproject', 'exampleproject.*'])
    
    # -- other metadata
    description='Setting up a python package',
    author='Rogier van der Geer',
    author_email='rogiervandergeer@godatadriven.com',
    
    
    """
    Could technically have just used find_packages() without any args, but
    this could have resulted in unwanted packages if there was an __init__.py file somewhere else
    """ 
    
    # like requirmenets.txt
    install_requires=[
        'PyYAML',
        'pandas==0.23.3',
        'numpy>=1.14.5',
        'matplotlib>=2.2.0,,
        'jupyter'
    ]
    
    #if want only certain packages installed in some cases
    # how would install these extra packages:  pip install -e ".[interactive]"
    extras_require={
        'interactive': ['matplotlib>=2.2.0', 'jupyter'],
    }
)

# to now install the package (-e puts it in editable mode so we not have to reinstall if files change, but will need to reload package)
pip install -e .
